# Spatial optimization of Wellingtonâ€™s urban development

Sam Archie & Jamie Fleming, supervised by Tom Logan

### In 2019, Wellington sought community input while re-writing its District Plan. The District Plan guides where and how future urban development can occur. In its solicitation, the council released analysis showing five potential scenarios: baseline, suburban centres, centralization, natural hazards, and greenfield. The expectation is that the preferred scenario will represent a blend of these.
### However, there are some things we cannot choose. Natural hazards are going to impact us under any of these scenarios. What will the effect of these hazards be on the other scenarios? Similarly, what are the vehicle emissions resulting from each scenario proposed?
### Can we find an optimal, or a series of optimal, scenarios that are better than these ones for a range of attributes?
