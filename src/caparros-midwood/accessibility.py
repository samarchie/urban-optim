Calculate_Accessibility 25/05/15
Author: Daniel Caparros-Midwood

To calculate the performance of a spatial plan for ùëìùëëùëñùë†ùë° the Calculate Accessibility
module shown below is run prior to the operation to calculate the shortest path
distance between the defined CBD/ town centre and the possible development sites.
The shortest path from each possible development site is then recorded to be
referenced by the Evaluate module.

Intended for incorporation with the Spatial Optimisation Framework

Module calculates shortest path distance of a road network from cells
available for development to identified CBDs Module is preprocessed to produce
a lookup table to calculate fdist
