Evaluate 25/05/15
Author: Daniel Caparros-Midwood

The evaluation module receives spatial plans of development and determines the
performance against a series of objectives. Before calling the module, development
plans, ùê∑, in the form [(ùëñ,ùëó),(ùëñ,ùëó),(ùëñ,ùëó)‚Ä¶] are spatial located onto a gridded spatial
plan [[0,0,0‚Ä¶],[0,1,0..],[0,1,1..]] to be directly assessed against the inputted
spatial grids for floodzone etc.

This module forms the evaluation portion of the spatial optimisation framework
for the Middlesbrough Cases Study. It takes development plans plotted against the
stuy area and returns their performance in the following objectives:
1. fheat
2. fflood
3. fdist
4. fsprawl
5. fgreenspace
