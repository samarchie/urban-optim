NonDom_Sort Module 26/05/15
Author: Daniel Caparros-Midoowd

The non-dominated sorting module shown below takes the solutions found by the
optimisation module and determines those which are non-dominated. The algorithm
is based on Mishra & Harit's (2010) algorithm. Moreover the module can determine
non-dominated sets between specified objectives using the â€˜ObjFun' variable.

Non dominated sorting algorithm to extract Pareto-optimal solutions.
The algorithm is based on Mishra & Harit's (2010) algorithm, first sort the solutions
by the first objective before iteratively comparing thier performances. By sorting them
we put solutions which are most likely to dominate at the start leading to less computations.
Throughout a non-dominated list of solutions is maintained and returned.

Requirements:
+ Objecives,f, requiring maximisation need to be multiplied by -1 prior
+ Solutions need to be in form [Solution number, Spatial Plan, Fitnesses]
+ Fitnesses need to be in the form [f1,f2,f3...]
+ Obj_Func need to be a list of fitness indexes
