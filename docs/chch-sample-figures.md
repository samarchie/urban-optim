**Figure 1.** Proportions of existing urban densities of Christchurch in 2018, by statistical area. *Note: A 3D interactive spatial plot of existing densities can be found [here](https://samarchie.github.io/urban-optim/chch-existing-density.html)*

**Figure 4.** Performance of Pareto-optimal spatial plans that dominate in one objective across all objectives. (Parents = 250, Generations = 250, Balanced weightings, High dwelling projection)

**Figure 5.** Ranked Pareto-optimal development sites. Darker blue signifies where statistical areas appeared more often in the MOPO sets. (Parents = 250, Generations = 250, Balanced weightings, High dwelling projection)

**Figure 6.** Spatial variability of urban densities of Ōtautahi Christchurch, by statistical area, where the height and colour of the extruded statistical areas indicate relative urban density. (top) 2018 density, (middle) added average added density of top 1% of development plans ranked by combined objective functions and (bottom) combination of the two above spatial plans, which envisions a more sustainable urban environment of Ōtautahi Christchurch.
